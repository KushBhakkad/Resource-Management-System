# Resource-Management-System

**Overview**

The **Resource Management System** is designed to streamline hospital resource allocation by calculating equipment requirements and optimizing delivery logistics. This project aims to assist healthcare facilities in managing resources more effectively during critical times.

**Features**

- **Hospital Resource Management**: Add, update, and manage hospitals with critical and normal patient counts.
- **Equipment Calculation**: Determine the total number of medical resources required.
- **Optimal Distribution**: Allocate resources to hospitals efficiently based on shortest paths and needs.
- **Route Optimization**: Calculate and display all possible delivery paths and their costs, identifying the shortest path for distribution.
- **Interactive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface developed with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library.
- **C++ Backend Logic**: Supplementary logic for advanced calculations and optimizations.

**Technologies Used**

- **Python**: For GUI and core logic.
- **Tkinter**: For developing the graphical user interface.
- **C++**: For supplementary backend logic.
- **Algorithms**: Implemented DFS for pathfinding and resource allocation optimization.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- C++ compiler (for optional use of the C++ code)
